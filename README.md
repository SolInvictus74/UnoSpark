# UnoSpark
UnoSpark is a library of advanced functions that is based on ZeroSpark. This library is designed for those who need access to more data and variables such as: Bullet Visual, Bullet Setting, and many more!

# How Can I Use It?
Download everything as a .zip file\
Extract to a folder.\
Copy the UnoSparkMain.uasset file to  your mod\
Create a child of UnoSparkMain in your mod and use it as you normally use any ZeroSparkMain child

# I already have a BP mod that use Zerospark, do I need to recreate this mod in UnoSpark?
No, you can reparent your BP to UnoSparkMain_Child (this file must be in your mod)

# HELP, I did what you suggest and now I can't run my mod!
Just reparent your BP to ZeroSparkMain (However, if you have followed the steps correctly, UnoSpark does not cause any type of crash)

# Can I help you create new functions for UnoSpark?
Any help is appreciated! DM me on discord (you can find me in Unreal Anime Mods server)

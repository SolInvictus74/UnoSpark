# UnoSpark
UnoSpark is a library of advanced functions that is based on ZeroSpark. This library is designed for those who need access to more data and variables that ZeroSpark does not currently make it possible to modify.

# How Can I Use It?
Download everything as a .zip file\
Extract to a folder.\
Copy the UnoSparkMain.uasset file to the Mods/Zerospark folder (within the UE5 project)\
Create a child of UnoSparkMain and put this in your mod (for this tutorial I'm gonna name this child "UnoSparkMain_Child")\
Create a child of UnoSparkMain_Child in your mod and use it as you normally use any ZeroSparkMain child

# I already have a BP mod that use Zerospark, do I need to recreate this mod in UnoSpark?
No, you can reparent your BP to UnoSparkMain_Child (this file must be in your mod)

# HELP, I did what you suggest and now I can't run my mod!
Just reparent your BP to ZeroSparkMain (However, if you have followed the steps correctly, UnoSpark does not cause any type of crash)

# Can I help you create new functions for UnoSpark?
Any help is appreciated!
